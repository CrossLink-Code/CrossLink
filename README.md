# CrossLink Smart Contracts

This repository contains the smart contracts for CrossLink, enabling cross-chain interactions between smart contracts on different blockchains. The contracts include a **CrossChainRouter** for managing cross-chain calls, **read contracts** for data retrieval, and **write contracts** for state modifications.

## Contracts
- **CrossChainRouter.sol** - Handles cross-chain requests and responses.
- **ContractA_Read.sol & ContractB_Read.sol** - Enable cross-chain data retrieval.
- **ContractA_Write.sol & ContractB_Write.sol** - Facilitate cross-chain state updates.
